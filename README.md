This project is a showcase of the HTML created by the code found on a [wonderful repository by Nathan Brixius](https://github.com/natebrix/capitoltour). For each map, I provided the code with list of locations that I would like to visit, and it handled everything else.

Here's a list of maps that I have found to be useful:
* [Indiana State Parks](https://ephemerant.github.io/optimal-roadtrips/IN_State_Parks.html)
* [Kentucky State Parks](https://ephemerant.github.io/optimal-roadtrips/KY_State_Parks.html) (includes Historic Sites and National Park)
* Colorado State Parks (includes National Parks, Historic Sites, and Recreation and Conservation Areas)
